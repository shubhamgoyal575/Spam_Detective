## üìß Spam Classifier - NLP Project
Welcome to the Spam Classifier project! This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of a machine learning model that predicts whether a given message is spam or ham. The project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and classify text data, with predictions performed using a trained machine learning model.

## üìñ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify messages into two categories:

- **Spam:** Unwanted or unsolicited messages, often promotional or fraudulent.
- **Ham:** Genuine, non-spam messages.
This project demonstrates the use of NLP techniques and machine learning to build a robust and accurate spam classifier.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used
**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:**
- numpy and pandas for data manipulation
- scikit-learn for building and evaluating the machine learning model
- nltk and re for text preprocessing
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## üßë‚Äçüíª Key Steps in the Project
### Data Collection:
The dataset contains labeled text messages, where each message is marked as either "spam" or "ham."

### Data Preprocessing:
- Removing unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stopwords.
- Tokenizing the text into individual words.
- Converting words into their base form using lemmatization or stemming.

### Feature Extraction:
Using Count Vectorizer , TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical form suitable for machine learning models.

### Model Selection and Training:
Trained various machine learning models, including:
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Selected the best-performing model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model on a test dataset.
Visualized performance metrics such as confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report.

### Prediction:
Built a function to predict whether a new message is spam or ham using the trained model.

üìä Results
Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset (update with your result).
- Precision: 100%
The model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between spam and ham messages.
